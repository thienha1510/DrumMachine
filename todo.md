# TODO
- Mobile support (touch interface for knobs)
- Make tempo changes and pauses/plays restart from the same place (probably with some accumulator parameter)
- Accent / velocity editing
- Audio to keep running in the background (even when `requstAnimationFrame` isn't being called)
- Different waveforms
- Master volume
- Filters (HP/LP)
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Shareable presets
- Effects (distortion, delay, reverb)
- Animated knob changes for preset loading / randomisation
- Sampler capabilities
- Knob configurable color and size
